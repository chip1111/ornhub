# ornhub

Project started because I wanted to scrape Ornstein's tweets into a pornhub style site (which you'll see from my initial files).
But that was months ago, before the Ornmemes took off in earnest, so I think it's now going to be wise to switch to a gallery of memes instead.

Key user features:

- A user can upload an Ornmeme (jpg / gif / mp4)
- A user can upvote or downvote any Ornmeme on the site
- A user can see the number of up and down votes each Ornmeme has received
- A user can view all the Ornmemes in gallery format on the site
- A user can click on an Ornmeme to expand it, and share directly on Twitter (crediting Ornhub)
- A user can see the Ornmemes with different filters similar to reddit (hot / new / all)

Other considerations:

- Do we actually want it to look like pornhub? 
- Do we want to include the explicit Ornmemes (I think a lot of them are a bit much tbh)
- What framework are we going to build this on that is going to enable as many people as possible to collaborate on? Ruby on Rails is the only one I've ever worked with, but open to all thoughts.
- How are we going to divide the work? 

I'm going to wireframe the site on Sketch now, but if anyone wants to start with back-end work, just let me know!
